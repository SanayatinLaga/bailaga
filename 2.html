<p><h2>Studies is my first priority. As a student, studying is not easy at all because there's a lot of assignments, projects, requirements, etc. but it is the work of every students and it is a challenge for us. We'll just have to do everything to surpass all of that. It is so much important because it will help us in the future to pursue or make our dreams come true. I need to do my best to finish my study so that I can return all the efforts and sacrifice of my parents.</p> </h2></center>

<center><p><h2>Family is my inspiration to achieve my goals in life. The one who would do anything and the who is always there to support me. When things get hard, they're always telling me to keep going and never give up. I am so lucky to have them, they are the reason why I'm strong to face all the struggles that I've been encountered. I will do everything to make them proud because one of my dream in life is seeing my FAMILY happy for me.</p> </h2></center>
